# CaseForge automated pipeline

`simple_serve.py` should start a webserver that allows converting zip files
generated by the structure scanner into 3D models to be printed with a 3D
printer.

Run it as

```bash
python simple_serve.py
```

then go to `0.0.0.0` on a browser.

It definitely requires blender, and some python packages that are listed under `requirements.txt` and `autocase3d/requirements.txt`.

This will be cleaned up eventually.
